# NavalQuest
My final project from my Visual Basic class in freshman year of high school, 2012-2013 school year. As Ryan-from-9th-grade describes it, "NavalQuest is a nautical strategy game made by Ryan Hecht, based on the board game Battleship by Milton Bradley. Made in May of 2013 as Ryan's final Visual Basic class project, the game represents the manifestation of the skills he has learned in the language over the year. Ryan is excited to broaden his coding horizons and start new projects in the months to come. Follow him on Twitter @Ryan_Hecht for the latest on new projects. Enjoy NavalQuest, the classic game of nautical strategy."
